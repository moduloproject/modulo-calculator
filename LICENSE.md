## What the License applies to
The License applies to any work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of the License. If sections of that work are not derived from the Original Project, and are independent and separate works, then the License and its terms do not apply to those sections when You distribute them as separate works. When distributed with the Original Project, the distribution of the Fork must comply with the terms of the License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire Fork regardless the authors.


# I) Making changes
## a) Permissions
You may Redistribute the source with changes made; You are free to choose the type of changes, as long as they comply with the License.

## b) Requirements
Changes to the Project must be made inside a Fork. These changes can be anything, including style changes, features changes and branding changes. These changes must be visible to the user. If no changes that are visible to the user are made, the Original Authors have the right to revoke Your rights. You must include prominent notices in a Fork stating that You changed the files and the date of any change.


# 2) Licensing
## a) Attribution
You are allowed to Redistribute the Original Source of the Project, providing that You attribute proper credit to the original authors, crediting includes, mentioning the original author’s names, the original license, the original copyright notice, the original product name and a link to the Original Source. The attribution must be accessible to users in Your program.

## b) Fork Licensing
You must license any work that You distribute or publish, that in whole or in part that is derived from the Original Source or any part thereof, as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of the License.

You shall not modify any part of the License when redistributing the Original Source.

## c) License and copyright notice
You may distribute verbatim copies of the program's Source Code as You receive it, in any medium, provided that You conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to the License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Original Source a copy of the License along with the program.

## d) Sublicensing
You may not sublicense any part of the Original Source without the original authors' permission. Sublicensing the Original Source without the original authors' permission will result in sanctions as described in section 5 of the License.


# 3) Distributing
## a) Commercial use
"Commercial Use" refers to any methods that gain funds to you, including advertising or selling. Any act of commercial use requires written permission from the Original Authors.

## b) Branding
You shall not Redistribute the original author’s work with the same trademark and branding. Your branding should also be different from the original branding. Users must be able to distinguish the branding of Your application from the original application.


# 4) Original authors rights and responsibility
## a) Responsibility
In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or Redistribute the Original Source as permitted above, be liable to You for damages, even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

## b) License sanctions
By modifying or distributing the Original Source (or any work based on the program), You indicate Your acceptance of the License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Original Source or works based on it. If You do not accept or respect the License, Your rights will be terminated.

# V) External sanctions
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on You (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of the License, they do not excuse You from the conditions of the License.  If You cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously Your obligations under the License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence You may not re-distribute the Original Source at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Original Source by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way You could satisfy both it and the License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
